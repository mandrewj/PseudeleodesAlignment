# PseudeleodesAlignment
EulerX alignment of Tricheleodes and Pseudeleodes taxonomies

This repository contains the input and output files for running the EulerX toolkit (https://github.com/EulerProject/EulerX).

Eleodes1.txt contains the input for EulerX, giving the two taxonomies (OLD and NEW) as well as a set of articulations between the two.

Eleodes1_mir.csv contains the output set of maximally informative relationships for the two taxonomies; that is, every taxon concept's relationship to every other concept is explicity stated, and all relationships are logically consistent with one another.

The two PDFs are the visualization outputs of EulerX showing the alignment of the two taxonomies.
